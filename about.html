        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm Marck Petersen. Based in Copenhagen, Denmark, I bring over three decades of robust experience in Quality Engineering across multiple domains and industries. My expertise lies in designing effective QA and Test processes tailored for both agile and traditional projects, with a strong advocacy for "built-in quality" and holistic testing.</p>
        <p>My approach integrates risk-oriented strategies with a focus on continual experimentation and learning, promoting agile methodologies such as Scrum and DevOps to enhance project outcomes. I'm a certified AT*SQA DevOps Tester, a Rapid Software Tester, and have knowledge in project management frameworks like PRINCE2 and SAFe 4.5 Agilist.</p>
        <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am passionate about human-centric processes and maintaining a culture of transparency and innovation within teams. My entrepreneurial and first-mover mindset allows me to see the bigger picture and initiate improvements continuously.</p>
        <p>On a personal note, I'm a family man, married with children. I enjoy staying active with fitness, boxing, and dancing. I also cherish the time spent at our summer house on the island of Orø and our family trips to Brazil.</p>

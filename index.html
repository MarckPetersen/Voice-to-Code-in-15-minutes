    Feature: Navigation Bar for Portfolio Website
      As a website user
      I want a navigation bar at the top of the page
      So that I can quickly navigate to different sections of the website

      Scenario: Navigation to the "About Me" section
        Given the user is on the homepage
        When the user clicks on "About Me" in the navigation bar
        Then the page should scroll to the "About Me" section

      Scenario: Navigation to the "Projects" section
        Given the user is on the homepage
        When the user clicks on "Projects" in the navigation bar
        Then the page should scroll to the "Projects" section
